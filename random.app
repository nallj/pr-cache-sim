#  Example Application File for Drachma

name: Random Application (a made-up application)

/#
  this is where you would put defining parameters
  to describe traits of an application's resource
  partitioning.

  all paramters are of the following format:
    <param name>: <param value>

  the following are acceptable definitions.
  descriptions with a double astrisk** are always required.
  descriptions with an asterisk* are required under certain circumstance
    
    name: "name of the application"**

    icap speed: "the speed in MHz of the ICAP"**
    icap width: "the number of bits the ICAP can
      transfer per clock cycle (at ICAP speed)"**

    prc speed: "the speed in MHz of the Partial
      Reconfiguration Controller"**

    static region speed: "the speed in MHz of the static
      regions"*
      > required if declaring static regions
    srX module count: "amount of modules residing
      in the static region X (where X <= 0)"
      there can be an arbitrary amount of SRs
      static regions

    rrX bitstream size: "amount of bytes required
      from the ICAP to reconfigure the
      reconfigurable region X (where X <= 0)"
      there can be an arbitrary amount of RRs
    rrX module Y speed: "the speed (in MHz) of module
      Y from reconfigurable region X"
      there can be an arbitrary amount of RMs per RR
