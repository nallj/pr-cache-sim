# Example Application File for Drachma
name: Random Application (a made-up application)

# Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP)
ICAP:
  # The speed (in MHz) of the ICAP (required).
  speed: 100.00
  # The number of bits the ICAP can transfer per clock cycle (required).
  width: 32

# Partial Reconfiguration Controller (PRC)
PRC:
  # The speed (in MHz) of the PRC (required).
  speed: 100.00

#    [TODO] task scheduling:
#     - fcfs (first come first serve)
#      * no jobs: schedule first
#      * jobs going 
#     - sjn (shortest job next): naive
#      * no jobs: schedule first
#      * 4 jobs, 2 in contention
#     - sjn (shortest job next): schedule contentious first
#      * no jobs: schedule first
#      * 4 jobs, 2 in contention
#     - priority - requires that metadata has priortiy within them.
#
#     - rr (round-robin) - doesn't make sense since this is for scheduling tasks on a single core; without preemption this wont work.
#     - "Weighted shortest job first" (WSJF) - too complicated of a scheduling algorithm to implement; jobs get weighted with the cost of delay so that the highest valued jobs get done sooner.
#     - shortest remaining time first (SRTF) - cant be done because it requires preemption


#    [TODO] rr selection policy:
#      - lowest flexibility (LFT_FE): choose the RR that can support the least bitstreams leaving the more
#        flexible RR free
#      * what about selection policies that take into account cache? a lower cost than pulling fresh is pulling from cache
#      * what about a task that can be done by two different implementations (2 diff bitstreams)
