  this is where you would put defining parameters
  to describe traits of a memory configuration. a
  memory configuration denotes the hierarchy of
  memory devices that are accessible by the ICAP.
  if the ICAP needs to locate a bitstream it will
  attempt to do so first in the lowest memory
  level; if cache is present, this will always
  be L1 first.

  all paramters are of the following format:
    <param name>: <param value>

  the following are acceptable definitions.
  descriptions with a double astrisk** are always required.
  descriptions with an asterisk* are required under certain circumstance
    
    name: "name of the memory configuration"**

    main name: "main memory name"
    main size: "main memory size (in kB)"**
    main read latency: "main memory read cost (in clock cycles)"**
    main search latency: "main memory search cost (in clock cycles)"**

    l1 name: "lowest cache level name"
    l1 size: "lowest cache level size (in kB)"*
      level's supported up to l9
      > required if declaring a cache level
    l1 read latency: "lowest cache level read cost (in clock cycles)"*
      > required if declaring a cache level
    l1 search latency: "lowest cache level search cost (in clock cycles)"*
      > required if declaring a cache level
